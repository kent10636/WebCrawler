# WebCrawler
Simple WebCrawers for [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) & [Cloudmusic](http://music.163.com/).

### Usage: 
Run ***WebCrawler/Unsplash/Unsplash.py*** in PyCharm  
Run ***WebCrawler/NeteaseMusic/NeteaseMusic.py*** in PyCharm

### PS: 
Other files are some other features I tried during my studying process, just ignore them.

### Special Thanks： 
This webcrawer is a learning practice mainly based on "http://www.cnblogs.com/Albert-Lee/" 's [《Python爬虫小白入门》](http://www.cnblogs.com/Albert-Lee/p/6226699.html)
(Some methods in this tutorial is no longer functional, so I change something to adapt Unsplash website.)
